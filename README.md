## Gameplay Description
This is an RPG game where you enter a dungeon and try to reach the end.
First you create a character by choosing a class and allocating the stat points given to you.
Next you enter the dungeon and an enemy will approach. You can either fight, run or rest. Running will mean you avoid the enemy but have a chance to take damage, resting means you heal to full health and fight means you will enter combat.
If you enter combat you will be able to either attack the enemy, use an item or run. Run will give you a chance to escape the encounter but if you fail you take a hit of damage from the enemy. Clicking item will give you the choice of what item to use and attack will make you hit the enemy.
If you defeat the enemy you will gain xp and when you levl up you will be given stat points that you can allocate to your different stats.
To beat the game you must defeat the dragon on the last floor of the dungeon


## Dependencies used
SDL3, SDL3_image and SDL3_tff

## Use of AI
I have used AI to generate the sprites for the enemies, the background image once the player has entered the dungeon and the image of the campfire shown when resting.
I have also used it for debugging code when videos or searching on websites have not worked. An example of this is when I was making the FadeTransition funtion as there was little information on how to do it and the problems I found when making it.

## Game programming patterns used
Game loop, update method, type object
